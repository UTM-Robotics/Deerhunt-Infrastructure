            <h1 class="mt-5"><b>Tutorial</b></h1>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Overview</h2>
            <p class="lead">The game is asynchronous turn-based with two players competing against each other.
                <br>The map is a <code>40x40</code> grid, with a few maps in rotation. Each map is symmetrical.
                <br>There is an odd number of resource nodes on the map.
                <br>There is fog of war which will restrict vision for both players.
                <br>Each game lasts for 100 rounds or if one player's units are eliminated.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Objectives</h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to win the game.
                <br>1. Eliminate all of the enemy's units.
                <br>2. Have more resources than the enemy by 100 turns. If resources are tied, Player 2 wins.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Units</h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two types of units available: Melees and Workers.
                <br>Melee units are able to attack other units and can duplicate itself to create more Melee units.
                <br>Worker units are able to mine resources from resource nodes, they cannot duplicate itself.
                <br>Players will start off with a few of each units.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Information</h2>
            <p class="lead">Every turn, players will be given basic information about the state of the game.
                <br><code>game_map</code> is the grid which represents the current map.
                <br><code>your_units</code> is the list of every unit that belongs to you.
                <br><code>enemy_units</code> is the list of every unit that your units can see (fog of war) that belong to the enemy.
                <br><code>resources</code> is the number of resources that you currently possess.
                <br><code>turns_left</code> is the number of turns that remain until the game ends.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Commands</h2>
            <p class="lead">Append commands for units to the <code>moves</code> list to perform actions.
                <br>Commands can be found in <code>helper_classes.py</code>, there is documentation for every command.
                <br>Use <code>your_units.get_all_unit_of_type('worker')</code> to get a list of all of your worker
                units.
                <br>Use <code>your_units.get_all_unit_of_type('melee')</code> to get a list of all of your melee units.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Moving</h2>
            <p class="lead">There are four directions that each unit can move in: <code>UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT</code>
                <br>Each unit can only move 1 space at time.
                <br>Use <code>unit.move(direction)</code> to move the indicated unit.
                <br>Use <code>map.bfs(start, end)</code> to get the shortest path from start to end.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Attacking</h2>
            <p class="lead">Melee units can attack a unit from 1 cardinal range away.
                <br>All units need only one attack to be killed.
                <br>Use <code>unit.attack(direction)</code> to perform an attack.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Mining</h2>
            <p class="lead">Worker units can mine a resource node if it is on top of one.
                <br>Resource nodes have a limited amount of resources.
                <br>It takes 5 turns to mine from a node. During this time, the worker is locked in place.
                <br>Use <code>unit.mine()</code> to begin mining for the indicated unit.
                <br>Use <code>map.closest_resources(unit)</code> to find the closest resource node from the unit.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">Duplicating</h2>
            <p class="lead">Melee units can duplicate itself to create another melee unit.
                <br>Duplication costs 75 resources and take 5 turns to complete. During this time, the melee is locked
                in place.
                <br>Use <code>unit.duplicate(direction)</code> to create a unit in the direction indicated.
            </p>
