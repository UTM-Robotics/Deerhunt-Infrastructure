            <h2 class="mt-5">Overview</h2>
            <p class="lead">The game is alternating turn-based with two players competing against each other.
                <br>The map is a grid, with a few maps in rotation. Each map is horizontally symmetrical.
                <br>There is an odd number of resource nodes on the map.
                <br>There is fog of war which will restrict vision for both players.
                <br>Each game lasts for 100 rounds or if one player's units are eliminated.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Objectives</h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to win the game.
                <br>1. Eliminate all of the enemy's units.
                <br>2. Have more resources than the enemy by 100 turns. If resources are tied, Player 2 wins.
            </p>
