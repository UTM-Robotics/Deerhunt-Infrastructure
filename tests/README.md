## Introduction

This directory contains all tests for the backend.

## Quickstart

Make sure your server is up and running. Then just run 'pytest' from within the tests folder.

```
$ cd tests
$ pytest
```

If you need some more info, add verbosity.
```
$ pytest -v
```

If you only want run tests within a single file, do:
```
$ pytest -v test_auth.py
```
