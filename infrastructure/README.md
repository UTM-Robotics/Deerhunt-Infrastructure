**deerhunt/**: Everything to do with the frontend lives here. You will find npm related files here as well as the frontend source files.
**server/**: All backend source files live in this folder.
**pytest/**: All unittests at least for the backend will live here. Currently empty but will be populated soon. Make sure you are familiar with  [Pytest Framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/#).
